# StatTracker
A Town of Salem mod that creates a spreadsheet of all your past games that you can easily work to visualize your stats.
Every game you play will have its general metadata added to a CSV file, which includes information such as whether you won, which role you had, what roles and names every player had, whether every player won, what scrolls you had equipped, your gamemode, etc.

I created this mod as a possible predecessor to a bigger mod with the aim to compile game history. I think it is absurd that game history is not a thing in this game.

Even though this mod is open-source, due to the nature of Town of Salem modding, I will not be providing any support on how to do so (except explain how my mods work). You're on your own.
